# Contributing to The JumpServer Docs

Welcome to the JumpServer Protocol! Thanks so much for helping us improve our documentation. Any contribution to this project, when it’s approved and merged, will eventually be visible on [https://github.com/ibuler/jumpserver-documentation/](https://github.com/ibuler/jumpserver-documentation/).

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## Contributor’s Guide

Most of our docs are written in Markdown. If you are not familiar with Markdown, learn more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). The files that you’ll likely be updating are inside of the “pages” folder. From there select a language in order to view the Markdown files.

Direct contributions are much appreciated for simple things (corrections, small additions to existing content). If the change is more complex, we encourage you to start a discussion in GitHub Issues or Discord first.

## Making changes

Once you located the file that you want to update, click on “Edit” which will create a new forked repo. You can make your edits there, and submit a PR. Alternatively, you can manually fork the repo, create a branch in your fork and make all the edits you want before submitting a PR.

Tag `ibuler/jumpserver-documentation-reviewers` in your PR to get the reviewers’ attention. Once we review it, we’ll likely provide feedback and might ask you for improvements. Once the review process is finalized and at least 2 people approve, the PR will be merged. We aim to provide a meaningful response to all PRs and issues from external contributors within 5 business days.

You can optionally [run the application locally](https://github.com/ibuler/jumpserver-documentation/blob/dev/README.md) to review your changes.

## Creating an issue

If you would like to report a bug, or propose a larger feature, please create an issue. Before doing so, please search existing issues for relevant keywords, in case your issue has already been raised by someone else.
